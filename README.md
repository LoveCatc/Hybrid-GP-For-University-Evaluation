# Hybrid-GP-For-University-Evaluation
Codes of building a hybrid GP model to do university evaluation forecasting.

## Usage

1. Clone this repo and also download the [M4-Dataset](https://github.com/Mcompetitions/M4-methods/tree/master/Dataset) and put them in the directory `./Dataset/`.
2. Use `conda install --file requirements.txt` to set up the environment.
3. Run the jupyter code. `main.ipynb` contains our model of predicting both M4-Dataset and academic evaluation indicator dataset. And `benchmark.ipynb` contains the remaining benchmarks mentioned in our paper.

## Note

For now we cannot provide the academic evaluation indicator dataset as it is from CNKI, which needs users to pay to obtain the data. One can contact the CNKI official for access of this data.
